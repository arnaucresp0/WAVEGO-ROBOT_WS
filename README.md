#  WAVEGO-ROBOT_WS


This repository contains the codebase for a project focused on developing and implementing autonomous navigation for a quadruped robot. The robot, a WaveGo quadruped, is equipped with servos controlled by an ESP32. The main controller is a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 22.04 Server, and simulations are performed on a PC Linux virtual machine.

**(THIS REPOSITORY CONTAIN ONLY THE ROS2 ROBOT WORKSPACE AND ITS PACKAGES)**

## Software Stack

- ROS 2 (Humble Hummingbird): Utilized as the core framework for robotic development.
- Nav2 (ROS 2 Navigation Stack): Employs global and local path planning for autonomous navigation.
- SLAM Toolbox: Used for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to create maps of the environment.
- LD19 LiDAR: Provides environmental perception data for navigation.
